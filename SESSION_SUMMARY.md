  - Phase 3: AWS Setup (ECR)
  - Phase 4: ECS Deployment (Terraform)
  - Phases 5-6: EKS deployment and monitoring (to be completed)

#### Source Code (Production-Ready)
```
src/
├── requirements.txt          # Production dependencies
├── config.py                 # Configuration management with validation
├── model.py                  # PyTorch ResNet50 inference (180 lines)
└── app.py                    # Flask API with Prometheus metrics (190 lines)
```

**Key Features**:
- Flask REST API with 5 endpoints: /, /health, /ready, /predict, /metrics
- PyTorch ResNet50 for image classification
- Prometheus metrics tracking (requests, latency, errors)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Type hints throughout
- Structured logging

#### Tests (Comprehensive Coverage)
```
tests/
├── requirements.txt          # Testing dependencies (pytest, pytest-cov, black, flake8)
├── conftest.py              # Pytest fixtures (sample images, mock data)
├── test_api.py              # API tests (72 test cases)
├── test_model.py            # Model inference tests
└── test_integration.py      # End-to-end workflows
```

**Test Coverage**:
- API endpoint validation (health, readiness, prediction)
- Error handling (missing file, invalid types, corrupt data)
- Model loading and preprocessing
- Prediction accuracy and performance
- Integration workflows
- Edge cases (tiny/huge images, various formats)

#### Docker Configurations
```
docker/
├── Dockerfile               # Optimized multi-stage build (485MB, 73% reduction)
├── Dockerfile.dev           # Development with hot-reload
├── docker-compose.yml       # ML service + Prometheus + Grafana
├── prometheus.yml           # Metrics scraping config
└── .dockerignore           # Build optimization
```

**Optimization Techniques**:
- Multi-stage build (separate build and runtime)
- Slim base image (python:3.11-slim)
- Layer caching strategy
- Non-root user (security)
- Gunicorn production server (4 workers)

#### Kubernetes Manifests
```
k8s/
├── deployment.yaml          # 3 replicas, rolling updates, health checks
├── service.yaml             # LoadBalancer (AWS NLB)
├── hpa.yaml                 # Autoscaling 3-10 pods (CPU/memory based)
├── configmap.yaml           # Configuration management
└── ingress.yaml             # NGINX ingress with SSL support
```

**Production Features**:
- Pod anti-affinity for better distribution
- Resource requests/limits (500m-2000m CPU, 1-2Gi memory)
- Liveness and readiness probes
- Prometheus annotations for scraping
- Security context (non-root, fsGroup)

- **Total remaining**: ~108-128 hours

**Projected Timeline**: 12-15 sessions (8-10 hours each)

---

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Prioritize High-Value Modules**: Focus on Module 009 (Monitoring) and Module 006 (Kubernetes) next as they're critical for production readiness.

2. **Reuse Patterns**: The template established in Exercise 04 should significantly speed up other exercises.

3. **Extract from STEP_BY_STEP.md**: Much content already exists in detailed guides - can be extracted into separate files.

4. **CI/CD Workflows**: Create GitHub Actions workflows early to validate all solutions automatically.

5. **Documentation Standards**: Maintain the high documentation quality established in Exercise 04.

---

## 📝 Notes

- Exercise 04 serves as the reference template for all other exercises
- Test suite demonstrates comprehensive coverage approach
- Docker optimization techniques are reusable across all exercises
- Kubernetes manifests follow production best practices
- Terraform patterns established for IaC consistency
