## Tips for Success

### Debugging Mindset

1. **Stay Calm**: Every bug is solvable
2. **Be Systematic**: Follow the debugging workflows
3. **Read Error Messages**: They usually tell you what's wrong
4. **Google Wisely**: Include error message + technology + version
5. **Ask for Help**: After you've tried the guides

### Production Mindset

1. **Test Everything**: If it's not tested, it's broken
2. **Document Everything**: Future you will thank you
3. **Monitor Everything**: You can't fix what you can't see
4. **Assume Failure**: Plan for things to go wrong
5. **Security First**: Never compromise on security

### Optimization Mindset

1. **Measure First**: Don't optimize blindly
2. **Start Simple**: Low-hanging fruit first
3. **Benchmark**: Before and after comparisons
4. **Diminishing Returns**: Know when to stop
5. **Readability Counts**: Don't sacrifice clarity
