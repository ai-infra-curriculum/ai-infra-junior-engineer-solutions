## Git Flow

**Best for:** Traditional software releases, projects with scheduled releases

### Branch Structure

```
main (production)
  |
  +-- develop (integration)
        |
        +-- feature/* (new features)
        +-- release/* (release preparation)
        +-- hotfix/* (urgent production fixes)
```

### Branch Types

1. **main/master**: Production-ready code
   - Always deployable
   - Tagged with version numbers
   - Never commit directly

2. **develop**: Integration branch
   - Latest delivered development changes
   - Base for feature branches
   - Merged to release branches

3. **feature/**: New features
   - Branch from: `develop`
   - Merge to: `develop`
   - Naming: `feature/user-authentication`, `feature/model-serving-api`

4. **release/**: Release preparation
   - Branch from: `develop`
   - Merge to: `main` and `develop`
   - Naming: `release/1.0.0`, `release/2.1.0`

5. **hotfix/**: Urgent production fixes
   - Branch from: `main`
   - Merge to: `main` and `develop`
   - Naming: `hotfix/critical-bug`, `hotfix/security-patch`

### Workflow Example

```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/add-model-caching

# Work on feature
git add .
git commit -m "feat(cache): implement model caching"
git push origin feature/add-model-caching

# Create PR: feature/add-model-caching -> develop

# After PR approval and merge, prepare release
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b release/1.0.0

# Bug fixes in release branch
git commit -m "fix(release): update dependencies"

# Create PR: release/1.0.0 -> main

# After release, tag main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0

# Merge release back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge release/1.0.0
git push origin develop
```

### Pros
- Clear structure for releases
- Parallel development streams
- Supports multiple release versions
- Good for scheduled releases

### Cons
- Complex for small teams
- Overhead for continuous deployment
- Can have long-lived branches

---

## GitHub Flow

**Best for:** Continuous deployment, web applications, small teams

### Branch Structure

```
main
  |
  +-- feature/user-auth
  +-- fix/api-error
  +-- docs/update-readme
```

### Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/add-logging

# 2. Add commits
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add structured logging"
git push origin feature/add-logging

# 3. Create Pull Request

# 4. Review and discuss

# 5. Deploy from branch (optional - test in staging)

# 6. Merge to main

# 7. Deploy from main (automatically via CI/CD)

# 8. Delete branch
git branch -d feature/add-logging
git push origin --delete feature/add-logging
```

### Rules

1. **main is always deployable**
2. **Branch from main for any change**
3. **Use descriptive branch names**
4. **Open PR early** (for discussion)
5. **Review before merge**
6. **Deploy immediately after merge**
7. **Delete merged branches**

### Pros
- Simple and straightforward
- Continuous deployment friendly
- Fast feedback cycle
- Easy to understand

### Cons
- No support for multiple versions
- Less structured than Git Flow
- Requires robust CI/CD

---

## GitLab Flow

**Best for:** Projects with multiple environments, staged deployments

### Environment Branches

```
main (development)
  |
  +-- staging
  |     |
  |     +-- production
  |
  +-- feature/new-feature
```

### Workflow

```bash
# Develop on feature branches
git checkout -b feature/new-api
git commit -m "feat: add new API endpoint"

# Merge to main
# (via merge request)

# After testing on main, merge to staging
git checkout staging
git merge main

# After staging validation, merge to production
git checkout production
git merge staging
```

### With Release Branches

```
main
  |
  +-- release/1.0
  +-- release/2.0
  +-- feature/new-feature
```

### Pros
- Clear environment progression
- Supports multiple releases
- Gradual rollout
- Easy rollbacks

### Cons
- More complex than GitHub Flow
- Requires good automation
- Can accumulate technical debt in old releases

---

## Trunk-Based Development

**Best for:** High-velocity teams, continuous integration

### Structure

```
main (trunk)
  |
  +-- short-lived feature branches (< 1 day)
```

### Principles

1. **All developers commit to main (trunk) frequently**
2. **Feature branches are short-lived** (hours, not days)
3. **Use feature flags** for incomplete features
4. **Automated testing is critical**
5. **Small, incremental changes**

### Workflow

```bash
# Create short-lived branch
git checkout -b add-validation
git commit -m "feat: add input validation"

# Rebase and merge same day
git checkout main
git pull --rebase origin main
git checkout add-validation
git rebase main
git checkout main
git merge add-validation --ff-only

# Push immediately
git push origin main
```

### With Feature Flags

```python
# Use feature flags for incomplete features
if feature_flags.is_enabled('new_model_architecture'):
    model = NewModelArchitecture()
else:
    model = OldModelArchitecture()
```

### Pros
- Simplest possible workflow
- Continuous integration
- Fast feedback
- Forces small changes

### Cons
- Requires discipline
- Needs robust CI/CD
- Feature flags add complexity
- Not suitable for all teams

## ML-Specific Considerations

### Challenge: Large Model Files

**Problem:** Model files are too large for Git

**Solutions:**

1. **Git LFS (Large File Storage)**
   ```bash
   git lfs track "*.h5"
   git lfs track "*.pkl"
   git add .gitattributes
   ```

2. **DVC (Data Version Control)**
   ```bash
   dvc add models/model.h5
   git add models/model.h5.dvc .gitignore
   git commit -m "feat: add trained model"
   ```

3. **External Storage + Metadata**
   ```yaml
   # model_metadata.yaml
   model:
     name: sentiment_classifier_v1
     version: 1.0.0
     storage: s3://models/sentiment_classifier_v1.h5
     sha256: abc123...
   ```

### Challenge: Experiment Tracking

**Branch Strategy for Experiments:**

```
main
  |
  +-- experiments/bert-finetuning
  +-- experiments/data-augmentation
  +-- experiments/hyperparameter-tuning
```

**Workflow:**

```bash
# Create experiment branch
git checkout -b experiments/new-architecture

# Track experiments with MLflow, Weights & Biases
mlflow.start_run(run_name="new-architecture")
mlflow.log_params(params)
mlflow.log_metrics(metrics)

# Keep experiment code in branch
# Only merge successful experiments to main
```

### Challenge: Data Versioning

**Strategy:**

1. **Never commit raw data**
2. **Version data separately with DVC**
3. **Document data in README**
4. **Track data lineage in code**

```python
# data_config.py
DATA_VERSION = "v2.1.0"
DATA_SOURCE = "s3://data-bucket/dataset-v2.1.0/"
DATA_HASH = "sha256:abc123..."
```

### Challenge: Model Registry Integration

**Branching for Model Deployment:**

```
main
  |
  +-- models/staging
  +-- models/production
```

**Workflow:**

```bash
# Deploy to staging
git checkout models/staging
git merge main
# Triggers deployment to staging model registry

# After validation, deploy to production
git checkout models/production
git merge models/staging
# Triggers deployment to production model registry
```

### Recommended Strategy for ML Projects

**For Research/Experimentation:**
- Use **trunk-based** with experiment branches
- Keep experiments separate
- Merge only successful experiments

**For Production ML Systems:**
- Use **GitLab Flow** with environment branches
- Separate staging/production deployments
- Use DVC for data/models
- Integrate with model registry

**For ML Infrastructure:**
- Use **GitHub Flow** for infrastructure code
- Continuous deployment for infrastructure
- Separate repos for code vs. models

## Choosing the Right Strategy

### Decision Matrix

| Factor | Git Flow | GitHub Flow | GitLab Flow | Trunk-Based |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Team Size | Large | Small-Medium | Medium-Large | Any |
| Release Cycle | Scheduled | Continuous | Staged | Continuous |
| Complexity | High | Low | Medium | Very Low |
| Multiple Versions | Yes | No | Yes | No |
| CI/CD Required | Medium | High | High | Critical |
| Learning Curve | Steep | Easy | Medium | Easy |

### Recommendations

**For Junior AI Infrastructure Engineers:**

1. **Start with GitHub Flow**
   - Simple to learn
   - Gets you practicing good habits
   - Easy to understand

2. **Graduate to GitLab Flow**
   - When you need staging environments
   - For production systems
   - Better for ML deployments

3. **Avoid Git Flow initially**
   - Too complex for learning
   - Overkill for most projects
   - Use only if required by team

4. **Experiment with Trunk-Based**
   - For personal projects
   - When you're comfortable with CI/CD
   - Good for rapid prototyping

## Best Practices (All Strategies)

### 1. Branch Naming Conventions

```
feature/description
bugfix/description
hotfix/description
release/version
experiment/description
docs/description
refactor/description
```

### 2. Keep Branches Short-Lived

- Feature branches: < 1 week
- Experiment branches: Can be longer
- Delete after merge

### 3. Commit Often

- Small, focused commits
- Each commit should be meaningful
- Use conventional commits

### 4. Pull Before Push

```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
git push origin feature/my-feature
```

### 5. Never Commit to Main Directly

- Always use branches
- Always use pull requests
- Always get reviews

### 6. Clean Up Regularly

```bash
# Delete merged branches
git branch -d feature/old-feature

# Prune remote references
git remote prune origin

# Clean up local branches
git branch --merged | grep -v "\\*\\|main\\|develop" | xargs -n 1 git branch -d
```

## Summary

- **Git Flow**: Complex, scheduled releases, multiple versions
- **GitHub Flow**: Simple, continuous deployment, single version
- **GitLab Flow**: Staged deployments, environment branches
- **Trunk-Based**: Fastest, requires discipline and automation

**For most junior engineers**: Start with **GitHub Flow**, evolve based on project needs.

**For ML projects**: Consider **GitLab Flow** with DVC and model registry integration.
