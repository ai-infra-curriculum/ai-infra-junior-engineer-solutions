# Exercise 01: Step-by-Step Guide

## Overview

This guide walks you through completing your AI Infrastructure career assessment and planning exercise.

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê Easy (No coding required)

---

## Step 1: Complete Skills Assessment (45-60 min)

### 1.1 Open the Template

```bash
cd docs/
cp skills-assessment.md skills-assessment-completed.md
```

### 1.2 Rate Each Skill Honestly

Open `skills-assessment-completed.md` in your text editor and rate yourself (0-5) for each skill:

- **0** = Never heard of it
- **1** = Heard of it, read about it
- **2** = Completed tutorials
- **3** = Used in personal projects
- **4** = Used professionally
- **5** = Expert (can teach others)

**Tips:**
- Be brutally honest - this is for you
- Don't inflate scores - it won't help your learning
- It's okay to have many low scores as a beginner

### 1.3 Calculate Your Totals

Add up scores for each category and calculate percentages:

```
Category Score = (Your Score / Max Score) √ó 100
```

### 1.4 Identify Top 5 Priority Areas

List your 5 lowest-scoring areas that are essential for junior roles:
1. Must focus on these first
2. Find specific resources for each
3. Set measurable goals

**Example:**
- Docker basics: Current 0/5, Target 3/5 in 2 months
- Resource: Docker Mastery course on Udemy

---

## Step 2: Research Job Market (60-90 min)

### 2.3 Save 10 Job Descriptions

For each job posting, note:
- Company name
- Job title
- Required skills (hard requirements)
- Preferred skills (nice-to-haves)
- Salary range (if listed)
- Location/remote option

### 2.4 Identify Patterns

Create `docs/job-market-research.md`:

```markdown
# Job Market Research

## Step 3: Create Learning Plan (60-90 min)

### 3.1 Copy the Template

```bash
cp learning-plan-template.md learning-plan.md
```

### 3.2 Personalize Your Plan

Fill in:
- Your name and start date
- Current experience level
- Available study time per week

### 3.3 Customize Monthly Goals

Based on your skills assessment, adjust:
- **Weak areas** ‚Üí Spend more time
- **Strong areas** ‚Üí Move faster or skip

**Example Adjustment:**
```markdown
## Month 1: Foundations

Original plan: Python (2 weeks)
Your adjustment: Python (1 week) - I already know basics
Add: Extra week for Docker (identified as gap)
```

### 3.4 Select Resources

For each topic, choose:
- 1 primary course/book
- 1 practice platform
- 1 project idea

Prioritize:
- Free resources when possible
- Hands-on over theory
- Community-recommended resources

### 3.5 Set Weekly Schedule

Define when you'll study:
```markdown
Monday 7-8PM: Course videos
Tuesday 7-9PM: Hands-on practice
Saturday 10AM-1PM: Project work
```

Be realistic - it's better to do 1 hour daily than 10 hours on weekends.

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't know how to rate myself"

**Solution:** Research the skill first
- Watch a 10-min intro video
- Read the Wikipedia article
- Then rate: 0 if still confused, 1 if you understand the concept

### "All my scores are low"

**Solution:** That's normal for beginners!
- Everyone starts somewhere
- Focus on top 5 priorities
- Celebrate progress, not perfection

### "I can't find 10 hours/week"

**Solution:** Start smaller
- Begin with 5 hours/week
- Build the habit first
- Gradually increase time

### "Job postings are overwhelming"

**Solution:** Break it down
- You don't need ALL skills on day 1
- Junior roles expect you to learn
- Focus on must-haves, not nice-to-haves

### "I'm not sure what to specialize in"

**Solution:** Don't worry yet
- First 6 months: Learn foundations
- Try different areas
- Specialization comes with experience
