## Integration with Previous Exercises

### Exercise 01: Observability Foundations
- Runbooks reference structured logs for investigation
- Trace IDs used to correlate errors across services
- OpenTelemetry spans help identify slow operations

**Example Usage**:
```logql
# Query logs for a specific trace (from runbook)
{container="inference-gateway"}
  | json
  | trace_id="550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
```

---

### Exercise 02: Prometheus Stack
- Alerting rules defined in `config/prometheus/alerting_rules.yml`
- Recording rules for SLO metrics
- Prometheus is source of truth for metrics during incidents

**Example Alert**:
```yaml
- alert: HighErrorRate
  expr: |
    (sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])) /
     sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))) * 100 > 5
  for: 2m
  labels:
    severity: critical
  annotations:
    runbook_url: "https://runbooks.company.com/001-high-error-rate"
```

---

### Exercise 03: Grafana Dashboards
- Runbooks reference specific dashboards
- SLO dashboard shows error budget status
- Application performance dashboard for triage

**Example Runbook Step**:
```markdown
### Step 2: Check Service Status
Dashboard: http://localhost:3000/d/app-performance
Look for:
- Current error rate
- Latency percentiles (P50, P95, P99)
- Request volume trends
```

---

### Exercise 04: Logging Pipeline
- Runbooks include LogQL queries for investigation
- Loki provides log context during incidents
- PII redaction ensures compliance during troubleshooting

**Example Runbook Step**:
```markdown
### Step 5: Examine Error Logs
Loki Query:
{container="inference-gateway"}
  | json
  | status_code >= 500
  | line_format "{{.timestamp}} [{{.status_code}}] {{.method}} {{.endpoint}}"
```

```
1. [14:23] Alert fires: HighErrorRate (12% error rate)
   ↓
2. [14:23] PagerDuty pages on-call engineer
   ↓
3. [14:24] Engineer acknowledges (1 min - within 2-min SLA)
   ↓
4. [14:24] Opens runbook: runbooks/001-high-error-rate.md
   ↓
5. [14:25] Triage (5 minutes):
   - Check dashboard: http://localhost:3000/d/app-performance
   - Check service health: curl http://localhost:8000/health
   - Check recent deployments: kubectl rollout history
   ↓
6. [14:27] Investigation (10 minutes):
   - Review logs: Loki query for 5xx errors
   - Check traces: Jaeger for slow/failed requests
   - Identify: Recent deployment v1.2.3 causing NPE
   ↓
7. [14:30] Mitigation (5 minutes):
   - Execute: kubectl rollout undo deployment/inference-gateway
   - Monitor: Watch error rate drop in dashboard
   ↓
8. [14:35] Verification:
   - Error rate: 12% → 0.8% (normal)
   - Latency: Normal
   - Service: Healthy
   ↓
9. [14:40] Resolution (after 10-min stability):
   - Post in #incidents: "RESOLVED - root cause: NPE in v1.2.3"
   - Calculate SLO impact: 4% error budget consumed
   - Create incident ticket: INC-2025-0123
   ↓
10. [Next day] Post-Incident Review:
    - Complete incident report using template
    - Five Whys root cause analysis
    - Action items: Add null check, improve tests
    - Schedule post-mortem meeting
```

**MTTR**: 17 minutes (detection to resolution)
**Within goal**: Yes (15-minute goal for HighErrorRate)

## Best Practices Demonstrated

### 1. Symptom-Based Alerting

Alert on user-visible symptoms (error rate) not internal states (process down).

### 2. Actionable Runbooks

Every step has:
- Clear commands (copy-paste ready)
- Expected outputs
- Decision criteria
- Time bounds

### 3. Blameless Culture

Incident template focuses on:
- What happened (not who)
- Why systems failed (not why person failed)
- How to prevent (not who to punish)

### 4. Error Budget Management

Objective criteria for:
- When to deploy (budget >50%)
- When to pause (budget 10-30%)
- When to freeze (budget <10%)

### 5. Continuous Improvement

After every incident:
- Update runbooks with learnings
- Add missing alerts
- Improve monitoring
- Automate mitigation

## Next Steps

This incident response framework provides the foundation for:

1. **Operational Excellence**: Handle incidents effectively when they occur
2. **Reliability Improvements**: Learn from incidents, prevent recurrence
3. **Team Preparedness**: Train new engineers with simulations
4. **Cultural Shift**: Embrace blameless post-mortems and error budgets
